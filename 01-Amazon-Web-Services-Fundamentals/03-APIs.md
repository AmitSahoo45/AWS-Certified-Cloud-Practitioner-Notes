# Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)
### Basics of Ports, Protocols, and HTTP

##### Ports and Protocols:
Ports listen for incoming connections, like doors to services.

HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) for web communication (HTTP and HTTPS for encryption).

HTTP Methods:
a. GET: Retrieve information.
b. POST: Submit data.
c. PUT: Replace data.
d. DELETE: Remove data.

### APIs and Protocols:
APIs define rules for programs to communicate, leveraging protocols like HTTP.
Cloud services like AWS use APIs for actions.

### AWS API and Cloud Management
##### AWS API:
Defines actions for managing AWS resources.
Used for operations like launching servers, creating users, managing databases.

##### API Usage:
Can be accessed via AWS Management Console, CLI, SDKs, or other interfaces.
All actions on AWS result in API calls, including visual and code-based interactions.

##### Common Language:
Leveraging HTTP and standard web protocols for cloud management.
API calls mirror HTTP methods (GET, PUT, POST, etc.).

Examples of API Usage
Amazon S3 API:G
GET Object: Retrieve objects from S3 (download files).
PUT Object: Upload objects to S3 (upload files).

##### Flight Aggregator API:
Example: Searching for flights using an API to interact with airlines.

API returns results based on search criteria.
Users can choose relevant flights based on API-provided data.
Importance of APIs in Cloud Computing

##### Integral to Cloud:
APIs are fundamental for cloud service interactions and management.
Every action on AWS involves an API call, ensuring standardized communication.

##### API Calls and Cloud Operations:
API calls perform operations like creating, updating, and deleting resources on AWS.
Cloud management tools and interfaces facilitate API-based interactions.
