- **IAM Roles**:
  - An IAM role is an identity with specific permissions.
  - Roles can be assumed by users, applications, and services.
  - They are accessed using API calls, specifically the STS (Security Token Service) assume role API.
  - When a role is assumed, short-term credentials are generated by the STS service.
  - Roles are used to grant permissions, and applications can leverage roles to gain AWS permissions.
  - Roles are temporary and grant permissions based on their assigned policies.

- **IAM Policies**:
  - IAM policies define permissions and are written in JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format.
  - Policies can be applied to users, groups, and roles (identity-based policies) or directly to resources like S3 buckets (resource-based policies).
  - Example policies:
    - Administrator Access Policy: Provides full access to all resources in AWS.
    - Resource-Based Policy: Allows specific actions on specific resources, e.g., allowing a user named Paul access to a specific S3 bucket with restricted access to certain prefixes.
  - Policies follow an "explicit allow" model, meaning actions are denied by default unless explicitly allowed in a policy statement.

- **Role Usage**:
  - Roles are frequently used to limit permissions, especially for temporary needs.
  - They allow users to assume additional permissions only when necessary.
  - Role-based access helps improve security by reducing the scope of permissions based on current requirements.
  - Roles are commonly used to grant access to specific resources like S3 buckets for limited durations.

- **Resource-Based Policies**:
  - Resource-based policies are applied directly to resources like S3 buckets.
  - These policies define who can access the resource and what actions they can perform.
  - Not all AWS services support resource-based policies, but they are crucial for controlling access to specific resources.
